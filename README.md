## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Requirements

- Any front-end technology is fair game, but we use mainly React in our app. If in doubt, you can use create-react-app to get started super fast.
- Share runnable code with us, either in: an online code sandbox like Glitch, or CodeSandbox, a git repository, or a zip file, if necessary
- The game is to be played between two humans on the same machine.
- Whomever clicks first will be "X". The next click will be "O", and so on.
- The game follows standard tic-tac-toe rules:
  - The game board is a 3x3 grid of squares.
  - The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
  - If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
- When a player wins or a draw is established, show the game status on screen with a "reset" button that clears the board and lets the players start again.
- It doesn't need to be pretty, but if there's time to spare, keep reading ...

## Advanced challenges

If you finish the initial challenge with time to spare, you can work on your choice of the following.

- The players decide who will be represented by "X" and who by "O".
- Use CSS and / or SVGs to make it a super-hot tic-tac-toe game.
- Let the users pick grids in sizes other than 3x3.
- Modify the code to allow playing against a computer.
